## Hi there 👋
welcone to my github page. I am learning multiple topics and usually keep assignments in this profile.
- 💻I’m currently doing multiple courses on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Machine learning related topics.
- 👨‍💻Learning Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau.
- 🛠 Have lot more to learn (guide me).
- ☕Badges : (will be updated later).
- ⚡️fascinated by recent advancements and love to know more.
- 🔭Looking forward for working with AI/ML/DS related projects (noobish, but hardworking).
- 💬Open to suggestions.
- ⬇️Some projects done are in repo (don't judge-as they're mostly based on coursera guidelines and requirements).
- 🍕Complex projects are Work in progress and might upload in new repo.
- 📜 Portfolio (need to make and present here)
- ⏳Strongly believe in upskilling as it saves time.

- 💯Cheat sheets and road maps (collected from others, mostly from LinkedIN) are also in repo, check them as it is very useful directly or indirectly.
- 💡Few other notable works (not in repo): Automation for testing, Analysis of data, Visualization with Python, R, Plotly, problem identification with pattern recognition.
- ❄️ Old school programmer with C,C++,Fortran (no, not just Hello World!) experience and programmed with Matlab, C2000, Arduino, PLC, FPGA, Raspberry Pi.
- 🧩Working with Optimization(meta-heuristic) algorithms ranging from GA, PSO, GWO, ACO, ABC, MBHS, TLBO,DE, SA, CS, MS, ES,.... (and some hybrid, modifications), Neural Networks (matlab toolbox and program) and Controllers (PI, Hysteresis, Deadbeat, MPC, SMC). 
- 📍Learning markdown too, so will update this page later.


🌟Thank you and have a nice day 🌟.

p.s: Github is fun. Sharing and improvising is better.
